# SSW Themes

This project contains the SSW style overrides for the common libraries used by SSW.

## Usage  
You will need a LESS compiler. 

 - For Visual Studio 2013 I recommend using the Web Essentials extension.
 - For Visual Studio 2015 I recommend you use Bower and Grunt to compile the less files.

## Bootstrap Theme  
1. Copy the Bootstrap folder to your project.
2. Reference the bootstrap.ssw.min.css (compiled from bootstrap.ssw.less)

Note that this folder contains the Bootstrap LESS source files. Update these to the latest version as needed.

## Kendo Theme
1. Copy the Kendo folder to your project.
2. Reference the kendo.ssw.min.css (compiled from kendo.ssw.less)

Don't forget to reference the kendo.common-bootstrap.min.css file provided by Kendo, before you reference our theme.
